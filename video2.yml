  - video: Living Doc.mp4    
    narration: The new version of LivingDoc allows you to define a default language for your builds. Previously, English was the default language used to parse feature files. Select your  project language in the build step from the drop-down list. Furthermore, the list of builds has been improved. The list now only contains those builds that include the SpecFlow Plus build step, and the entries are now sorted alphabetically. This is a real time-saver in cases where you have a lot of builds. And as you can see, our German language feature files have been parsed correctly.
